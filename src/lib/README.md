# Utility Functions

This directory contains shared utility functions and helpers for the Arabic DSM-5-TR Self-Evaluation Platform.

## Structure

- `utils/` - General utility functions (formatting, validation, etc.)
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `constants/` - Shared constants and configuration
- `types/` - Shared TypeScript types and interfaces

## Guidelines

- Keep functions pure and testable
- Export types alongside implementations
- Document complex utilities with JSDoc comments
- Follow TypeScript strict mode conventions
