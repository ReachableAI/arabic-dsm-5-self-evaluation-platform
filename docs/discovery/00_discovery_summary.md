## Executive Summary

This document captures the Discovery phase outputs for a premium Arabic (RTL) mental health self-evaluation web app inspired by the DSM-5-TR methodology. The app targets **Arabic-speaking general public** seeking to understand their mental health patterns through an educational, non-diagnostic lens.

### Key Decisions Captured

| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| **Target Audience** | General public (Arabic speakers) — simple language, gentle framing |
| **MVP Scope** | 4 categories: Anxiety, Depression, ADHD, OCD & Related |
| **User Accounts** | Anonymous only — maximum privacy, no data retention |
| **Clinical Model** | Standalone self-service with crisis resource links |
| **Visual Priority** | Premium AI-generated imagery throughout |

### Source Material

- **Book**: Arabic DSM-5-TR translation by Dr. Anwar Al-Hammadi
- **Pages**: ~500 pages covering 19 disorder categories
- **Format**: Structured A/B/C diagnostic criteria with ICD-10-CM codes
- **MVP Categories Extracted**: Anxiety (7 disorders), Depression (4 disorders), ADHD (3 presentations), OCD (5 disorders)

## Safety & Ethical Framing (Non-Negotiable)

This app is **educational self-awareness support**, NOT medical diagnosis.

### Required Throughout the App

1. **Clear Disclaimers**: Every result screen states this is not a diagnosis
2. **Crisis Resources**: Arabic-language helplines visible on every page
3. **Professional Referral**: Encourage consultation with licensed professionals
4. **No Severity Labels**: Avoid "You have severe depression" — use "Your responses suggest you may benefit from speaking with a professional"
5. **Opt-out Points**: Users can exit at any time without completing

### High-Risk Content Flags

- **Suicidal ideation questions** (Criterion 9 in MDD) → Immediate crisis resource popup
- **Self-harm indicators** (excoriation, trichotillomania) → Gentle framing, resources
- **Psychotic features** → Redirect to professional help, not self-assessment
