## 🎯 Overview

This platform helps Arabic-speaking users explore their mental health patterns through educational self-reflection tools. It is **NOT a diagnostic tool** — it's designed to increase awareness and encourage professional consultation when needed.

### Key Features (MVP)
- 🌐 **Arabic-first RTL design** — Not a translated English app
- 🔒 **Anonymous by default** — No accounts, no data collection
- 📱 **Mobile-first responsive** — Works beautifully on all devices
- 🎨 **AI-generated visuals** — Premium illustrations throughout
- 🆘 **Crisis-aware** — Integrated safety resources

### MVP Categories
1. **اضطرابات القلق** (Anxiety Disorders)
2. **الاضطرابات الاكتئابية** (Depressive Disorders)
3. **اضطراب نقص الانتباه** (ADHD)
4. **الوسواس القهري** (OCD & Related)

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

This application is for **educational self-awareness only**. It cannot:
- Diagnose any mental health condition
- Replace professional medical advice
- Provide treatment or medication recommendations

If you're experiencing distress, please speak with a qualified mental health professional.
